## HOW FAR CAN I WALK?

Rules:

1. If you roll a 1, 2: You go 1 step down
2. If you roll a 3,4 or 5: You go 1 step up
3. If you role a 6: You roll again and walk up the resulting number of steps

Things to take into consideration:

1. Cant go below step 0
2. 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs - If this happens, then you have to start again
3. You made a bet with your friend that you will reach step 60

What is the chance we will win this bet?
